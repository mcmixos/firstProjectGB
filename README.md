This program takes as input a pre-described array consisting of string elements, and then runs a method that creates a new array consisting only of those elements of the original array whose length is three or less characters, after that the program outputs the elements of the converted array in order.

The method described in the program works as follows: it takes the initial array as input, checks using the for loop how many elements satisfy the condition "three or fewer characters", creates a new array whose length is equal to the number of elements satisfying the condition, and then using the same for loop checks the elements of the initial array anew, writing to a new array only the elements that satisfy the condition.

The png file that is stored in the repository describes the algorithm of the method in more detail using a flowchart.
